    "#### What is Healthcare Fraud?\n",
    "Fraud is defined as any deliberate and dishonest act committed with the knowledge that it could result in an unauthorized benefit to the person committing the act or someone else who is similarly not entitled to the benefit. Healthcare fraud is one of the types of fraud.\n",
    "Here we will analyze and detect “Healthcare Provider Fraud” where the provider fills all the details and makes a claim on behalf of the beneficiary. Provider Fraud is one of the biggest problems that Medicare is facing currently.  Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers, physicians, beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims.\n",
    "As per the U.S. legislation, an insurance company should pay a legitimate healthcare claim within 30 days. So, there is very less time to properly investigate this. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices.  As per the Government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:\n",
    "a)\tBilling for services that were not provided.\n",
    "b)\tDuplicate submission of a claim for the same service.\n",
    "c)\tMisrepresenting the service provided.\n",
    "d)\tCharging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided.\n",
    "e)\tBilling for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered."

False Negative and False Positive should be as low as possible.If fraudulent providers are predicted as non-fraudulent (False Negative) it is a huge financial loss to the insurer and if legitimate providers are predicted as fraudulent (False Positive) it will cost for investigation and also it's a matter of reputation of the agency.\n",
    "2. Model interpretability is very important because the agency or insurer should justify that fraudulent activity and may need to setup a manual investigation. It should not be a black box type prediction.\n",
    "3. Insurer should pay the claim amount to the provider for legitimate claims within 30 days. So, there is no such strict latency constraints but it should not take more than a day because depending on the output of the model the agency may need to setup an investigation."

    "<h4>Provider Dataset:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "I will check the distribution of Fraudulent and Non-Fraudulent claims. I have already checked it and I can see there are 506 fraudulent provider(10%) and 4904 non fraudulent providers(90%), which is a highly imbalanced dataset. To mitigate that imbalance I can use either undersampling or oversampling. In a paper discussed above, random undersampling was used because of the very big size of the input data. But here the data size is not big so, I can use random oversampling technique for my case study. (I will try random undersampling as well to check which one is performing best.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Beneficiary Data:</h4>\n",
    "1. From the KYC details of the beneficiaries I can calculate the age of the patients. For those, whose DOD is not available I will consider the last date available from other dataset.<br>\n",
    "2. I will check for the other columns if there are any missing values. I need to imputhe the missing values based on domain knowledge or model based approach. If any of the chronic disease field is missing I will apply domin knowledge to impute it with yes or no. If annual reimbursement or annual deductible amount field is missing I can create a regression model to predict these values.<br>\n",
    "3. From the chronic disease fields of the patient I can calculate the risk score. If the patient has a particular chronic disease it has to be filled with 1 else 0. I can sum up all the columns of chronic disease for a patient to calculate the risk score. Risk score is an important feature in fraud detection. If patient with low risk score is claiming high amount this is suspicious.<br>\n",
    "4. I will plot countplot of Gender, State, Country to check which are the most occouring in the dataset.<br>\n",
    "5. I will plot PDF of AnnualDeductible amount and AnnualReimbursed amount to check the distribution and also to find the outliers.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Inpatient/Outpatient Data:</h4>\n",
    "1. From the claim start date and claim end date I will calculate total number of days of the claim. If any of the field is missing I will try to apply domain knowledge to impute that. It may be average number of claim date from the other patients or depending on the claim type.\n",
    "2. For all the Inpatients I need to calculate total number of admitted days in hospital in the similar way.\n",
    "3. Need to check Claim Reimbursed amount column. If there is any missing values I have to impute that using domain knowledge or model based approach.\n",
    "4. I will plot the count plot of attending physician, operating ohysician for inpatient as well as outpatient to check which all doctors are treating the patients most.\n",
    "5. I will plot the PDF of reimbursed amount to check the distribution for inpatient as well as outpatient.\n",
    "6. Add another column called \"TotalNoOfPhysiciansAttended\". That is equal to Attending + Operating + Other physicians.\n",
    "7. I will add another column called \"HospitalizationStatus\" in both the datasets, for Inpatients I will fill it with 1 and for outpatients with 0. So that after merging these claims can be distinguished.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Merge Datasets:</h4> I will merge all these datasets to get a global view of the data. First merge Inpatient and Outpatient data based on Claim ID then merge it whih Beneficiary data on BeneficiaryID and then merge the Provider dataset on ProviderID.

    "3. Countplot of Attending and Operating phisician separately for Fraudulent and Legitimate claims and check the top attending physians.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Feature Engineering:</b>\n",
    "1. Calculate average reimbursement received by patient. Average reimbursement = Total reimbursement received/no of claims.<br>\n",
    "2. Total number of claims per patient.<br>\n",
    "3. Average number of claim days per parient. Avg no of claim days = Total claim days/ Total no of claims.<br>\n",
    "4. Average number of hospitalization days per patient. Avg no of days hospitalized = Total No of days hospitalized/No of times hospitalized.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now group the data based on ProviderID as our objective is to predict potentially fraudulent providers and take the sum of all the features applicabe(Total amount deducted, total amount reimbursed, risk score of patients, chronic conditions, total number of days admitted, total number of days claimed, number of unique claims, number of impatients, total claims for patient, avg no of days patient was admitted, avg no of hospitalization days etc. )\n",
